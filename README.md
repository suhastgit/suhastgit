- 👋 Hi, I’m Suhas Talekar — @suhastgit
- 👀 I’m currently exploring the world of Web Engineering & Development, working across both front-end and back-end domains.
- 🌱 I’m currently building projects using Angular, React, Qwik, and TypeScript. In the past, I’ve worked with PHP, Node.js, Swift, Go, and Rust.
- 💬 However, I believe that “A true developer isn’t defined by the language they code in, but by the problems they solve.”
- 💞️ I occasionally write about technical topics on my blog — itbusinesshub.com.
